# Machine Vision using Python (MVUP01)

Machine vision has produced many helpful image-processing techniques in several fields, such as object
detection, classification, and segmentation. Machine vision is an interdisciplinary discipline combining
computer vision and machine learning methods, mainly deep learning, to solve vision problems. Common
problems, such as classification and localisation, are typical examples that combine these research fields.
These techniques have applications in many areas. Deep learning methods are commonly applied for
image classification, focusing on deep neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
including concepts of transfer learning applied to image classification. This course introduces basic
concepts of deep learning and machine vision applied to image classification using CNNs. To illustrate
these methods, a dataset of medically and forensically important flies is used. Other examples will also be
used during the course to illustrate the applications of machine vision in ecology.
By the end of the course, participants should:

- Understand the basic concepts behind the machine vision ecosystem in Python;
- Understand the machine vision pipeline workflow;
- Understand the application of standard Python packages such as OpenCV and Tensorflow;
- Understand the basic concepts behind Deep Neural Networks;
- Understand the basic concepts behind Convolutional Deep Neural Networks;
- Understand basic concepts behind Transfer learning;
- Have the confidence to implement basic Machine vision methods using Python;
- Have the confidence to combine basic computer vision and machine learning methods to
perform vision tasks;

## Day 1: A Short Course in Python Basics (9:30 - 17:30)
This day provides participants with the foundational Python skills required for machine vision tasks. This
day is designed for beginners or those needing a refresher in Python programming.

variables, data types, conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`), loops (`for`, `while`), and writing reusable
code using functions.
- Section 2 (Data Structures and File Handling in Python): Focuses on lists, dictionaries, tuples,
sets, and reading/writing files (e.g., CSVs) for data manipulation.

## Day 2: Fundamentals of Computer Vision (9:30 - 17:30)
This day focuses on the theoretical foundations of computer vision, detailing the main aspects.
- Section 3 (Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing): This section covers the
fundamental structure of an image, basic image handling techniques, and an introduction to
computer graphics.
