# Applications of Deep Learning and Machine Vision

Machine vision has produced many helpful image-processing techniques in several fields, such as object detection, classification, and segmentation. Machine vision is an interdisciplinary discipline combining computer vision and machine learning methods, mainly deep learning, to solve vision problems. Common problems, such as classification and localization, are typical examples that combine these research fields. These techniques have applications in many areas.

## Deep Learning Methods

Deep learning methods are commonly applied for image classification, focusing on deep neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including concepts of transfer learning applied to image classification.

## Course Objectives

This course aims to introduce basic concepts of deep learning and machine vision applied to image classification using CNNs. To illustrate these methods, a dataset of medically and forensically important flies is used.

## Tools and Resources

The Python programming language and the package TensorFlow will be used during the course, where we will present a brief introduction to the language. All the course materials and additional online resources will be provided to support users interested in this topic.
